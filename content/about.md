---

Hey there! My name is Nishaanth Guna. I am 22 and hold a bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering.

Interested in Web and Mobile application penetration testing. Currently working with <a href="https://appknox.com/"> Appknox</a> as a Security Researcher. Previously, I worked with <a href="http://www.ey.com/gl/en/services/advisory/ey-cybersecurity"> Ernst & Young</a> consulting Media and Technology companies to secure their digital footprint by performing Vulnerability Assessment and Penetration Testing.

When I am not typing on my keyboard, I like to explore new places, play CS 1.6, read hacker zines and blogs.

If you want me to test your application/infrastructure <a href="mailto:nguna@ucdavis.edu"> drop me a mail</a>.
